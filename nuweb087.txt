I have uploaded nuweb087.zip including sources by Preson Briggs and
the os/2 binary to :

hobbes (ftp-os2.nmsu.edu), 
now: /incoming
suggested: /os2/unix/tex

cdrom (ftp-os2.cdrom.com), 
now: /os2/incoming
suggested: /os2/tex

and CTAN (ftp.shsu.edu):
now: /incoming
suggested: tex-archive/web/nuweb/os2/  (needs to be created).

Replaces: Nothing really, except hopefully DOS versions of nuweb,
          running on some OS/2 machines.

Brief description:

I was looking in news groups for a tool for literate programming (web)
that'd allow me to use Fortran. (Extended) Pascal, and C and was portable
to or available for OS/2. I came accross an interesting FAQ for the
comp.literate.programming, and I got his personal reply:

To make it short: here is the working OS/2 version, with executable,
sources, and docs.

All you need to use it is:
a) LaTeX installed on your system (2.09 or 2e are fine)
b) print the nuwebman.dvi or nuwebman.ps files, read them
c) an editor
d) the emx runtime system (emxrt.zip, from ftp-os2.cdrom.com, or
   ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, for instance), version 0.9a fix pack 06 or 
   later installed. If you don't have it already installed
   fetch the index of one of these sites, and search (grep) for
   the pattern "emxrt.zip", or, if you can use regular expressions,
   "^emxrt.zip". Then download and istall it. It contains the runtime
   system in a dynamic link library which is shared by many other 
   programmes (say, gnu file utils, vi, emacs, less, probably even
   emTeX programmes). This allows the executables to stay small and lean
   but they won't run without it.
e) put nuweb.exe in your path.

It seems that this is the right tool for cs people who don't crave nice,
mathematical pretty print stuff (like some physicists prefer), and for
projects that involve mixing of languages, or involve languages that
other webs don't know about. (I like fweb, too, but fweb can't do
Extended Pascal, as an example, and so nuweb seems to be it for that
case.)
