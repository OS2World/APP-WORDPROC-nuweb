Here's an intermediate version of nuweb.  I've simply bundled up the
web source (nuweb.w), the generated .c files, an abbreviated nuweb.tex
file, and the assorted auxiliary files for latex'ing.

Note that it's still not completely portable to every system without
change.  In particular, it expect file-names to use '/' to delimit
directories and it still thinks tab stops are set every eight spaces.
It also uses tempnam() which may not be available everywhere.
tmpnam() might be made to work in some systems.  If all else fails,
just use some adequately unlikely filename.

To print the documentation, you must first run latex on the file
nuweb.tex.  To fix up all the citations, you'll need to run it twice:

	latex nuweb
	latex nuweb

Note that the distributed nuweb.tex is basically Chapter 1 of the
complete nuweb.tex generated by running nuweb against itself.

To actually build the nuweb executable, first

	touch nuweb.tex

then

	make

which should build an executable file called "nuweb".  After that, you
should be able to use the makefile to control everything very nicely.

If you have questions or comments (or just want the latest version),
please let me know. I expect to continue working on the documentation
for quite a while.
